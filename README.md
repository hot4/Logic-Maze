# Logic-Maze

Group Members: Timothy Ho, Uyen Uong

Features: 
The mazeSolver.pl program determines a solution through a maze given certain requirements for pressing buttons. The NLParser.pl program takes in a file where each line is a sentence and uses Definite Claus Grammars to parse the sentences and move the mouse if it is a valid move.

Bugs:
There are no known bugs, however, on our machines we had to change the name of file NLParser.pl to nLParser.pl in order to run it. We changed the name back to NLParser.pl but just in case it does not work, we included this comment.
