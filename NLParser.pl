% Setting up the definitive clause grammar ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The words that the parser needs to understand
article --> ["a"] | ["the"].
subject --> ["rat"] | ["rodent"].
pronoun --> ["einstein"] | ["he"] | ["it"].
verb --> ["ran"] | ["moved"] | ["pushed"] | ["scurried"].
object --> ["square"] | ["squares"] | ["cell"] | ["cells"] | ["button"].

digit(1) --> ["1"].
digit(2) --> ["2"].

digit(5) --> ["5"]. 
digit(6) --> ["6"].

subject_phrase --> article, subject; pronoun.

verb_phrase --> verb, object_phrase.
