% Setting up the definitive clause grammar ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The words that the parser needs to understand
article --> ["a"] | ["the"].
subject --> ["rat"] | ["rodent"].
pronoun --> ["einstein"] | ["he"] | ["it"].
verb --> ["ran"] | ["moved"] | ["pushed"] | ["scurried"].
object --> ["square"] | ["squares"] | ["cell"] | ["cells"] | ["button"].

digit(1) --> ["1"].
digit(2) --> ["2"].
digit(3) --> ["3"]. 
digit(4) --> ["4"]. 
digit(5) --> ["5"]. 
digit(6) --> ["6"]. 
digit(7) --> ["7"]. 
digit(8) --> ["8"]. 
digit(9) --> ["9"].

direction(up) --> ["up"].
direction(down) --> ["down"].

% Using features to extract the number of squares to use and the direction for sentences that move the mouse
sentence(Num, Dir) --> subject_phrase, verb_phrase(Num, Dir).
sentence --> subject_phrase, verb_phrase.

subject_phrase --> article, subject; pronoun.

verb_phrase --> verb, object_phrase.

direction_phrase(Num, Dir) --> digit(Num), object, direction(Dir).
